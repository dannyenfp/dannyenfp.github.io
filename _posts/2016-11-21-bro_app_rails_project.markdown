For my final project in Rails, I created a Bro App, which is a fitness app. 

You can sign in, sign out using Bcrypt, and you can even use facebook. 

The class workout belongs to a user, and has many directions, and many exercises through directions, with is the join table, for this app. Users are able to create these workouts, with directions and exercsies.
